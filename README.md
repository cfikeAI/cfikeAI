## üß† About Me

My work bridges AI and cloud infrastructure, and security to deliver production-ready solutions. I bring a unique combination of technical skill and strategic thinking from a dual background in IT and the humanities.

I earned my M.S. from UMBC with a 4.0 GPA, focusing on machine learning, and secure systems deployment.

## üìÇ Selected Projects

- **AI Book Library App**  
  Computer vision and OCR-based tool to catalog physical books, recommend similar titles, and track reading history. Fully Dockerized and integrated with Grafana.

- **Cloud ML Pipelines on Azure**  
  End-to-end MLOps deployment using Azure ML, Docker, and Terraform. Focused on reproducibility, automation, and production-readiness.

- **AI-Powered Avatar Voice Assistant**
  Built a modular, multimodal assistant combining local LLMs (LangChain), Coqui TTS, Bark, and image generation. Real-time UI with Gradio, optional SadTalker lip-syncing, and persona configuration. Demonstrates real-world GPU inference orchestration, voice synthesis, and scalable component design.
